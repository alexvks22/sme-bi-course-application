# Virtual Machine (VM) Exercises

## :information_source: Read this before getting started
- The two exercises should not replicate the exact actions shown in your screencast. The goal of exercises is for learners to apply what was learned in the screencasts to new problems or situations. This is best pedagogical practice for retaining and building skills. For example, this can be done by using another dataset between screencasts and exercises or focusing on a different portion of the dataset.
- Power BI / Tableau specific: We can only run free versions of BI software in our virtual machine exercises. In the case of Power BI, make sure the exercises can run on [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/) without any additional paid products. 
- Unsure what the scope of an exercise should be? Here's an [example](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-power-bi/getting-started-with-power-bi?ex=14) from Introduction to Power BI. The first chapter of most DataCamp courses are free, so take a look at our [BI courses](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses?technologies=Tableau&technologies=Power%20BI) to get a feel for how we assess and guide learners.

## 1st VM Exercise

#### Dataset

- [X] Add datasets used to the `datasets/` folder

#### Files

- [X] **Initial**: Add file to the `exercises/`  folder with the name `ex-1-intial.twbx` or `ex-1-intial.pbix` or `ex-1-initial.yxmd`, depending if you are auditioning for a Tableau/Power BI/Alteryx course.
- [ ] **Solution**: Add file to the `exercises/`  folder with the name `ex-1-sol.twbx` or `ex-1-sol.pbix` or `ex-1-sol.yxmd`
        (!) There is no solution file. Power BI Dashboards cannot be downloaded.

#### Learning Objective

*One measurable learning objective that this exercise assesses*

-> Learn how to Pin a visual

#### Context

*3 - 4 sentence description of why it’s important to learn how to do this task (linking back to the learning objective). Explain how this would be used in a real-life situation. Why is it useful, what problem does it solve?*

Let's add some visuals to our dashboard and start interacting with it. There is an already created report for you called: Data Camp - Employee Statistics. Now, you want to access this report and pin a single visual to a brand-new dashboard of yours. Pinning visuals from several reports, creates an insightful dashboard, but for now, let's stick to one report that has all the information that we need.

(!) Because there is no solution file, we cannot add the phrase: "If you lost progres..."

#### Steps to be executed by the student (max 6)

*Each bulleted instruction is a complete sentence that describes a specific task.*

- In the main page of Power BI Service, go to My Workspace and select the report DataCamp - Employee Statistics.
- From the report, choose the donut chart visual and click on the icon with the pin with the title Pin Visual.
- Choose New Dashboard from the options, and give the name Market Capitalization Statistics Dashboard.
- From the pop-up menu, select Go to the dashboard. If you didn't have the time to select, go again to My Workspace and select the Market Capitalization Statistics Dashboard.

#### Exercise question:
*This is a question presented to learners to check if the steps above were properly completed. It can be a multiple choice question or a question with a 1-3 word answer. It is often not possible to check if all the steps are completed, in this case; the priority is to check that the learner meets the learning objective.*

What is happening once you click the visual in the dashboard?

- Nothing, only the tooltip is shown.
- We are redirect to the report.

#### End goal:

*Add an image of the final visualization here.*

## 2nd VM Exercise

#### Dataset

- [X] Add datasets used to the `datasets/` folder

#### Files

- [X] **Initial**: Add file to the `exercises/`  folder with the name `ex-2-intial.twbx` or `ex-1-initial.yxmd`, depending if you are auditioning for a Tableau/Power BI/Alteryx course.
- [ ] **Solution**: Add file to the `exercises/`  folder with the name `ex-2-sol.twbx` or `ex-2-sol.pbix` or `ex-1-sol.yxmd`
      (!) There is no solution file. Power BI Dashboards cannot be downloaded.
      
#### Learning Objective

*One measurable learning objective that this exercise assesses*

Able to customize a Dashboard's Theme

#### Context

*3 - 4 sentence description of why it’s important to learn how to do this task (linking back to the learning objective). Explain how this would be used in a real-life situation. Why is it useful, what problem does it solve?*

Let's change the way that our dashboard looks like. Sometimes there might be a problem with the report's visual and the colors are identical and, apparently, invisible. Some other times, we might be required to change the dashboard theme coloring to adhere the Brand's coloring. In all the cases, adjusting a dashboard theme can actually help not only for visually appealing cases, but for accessibility issues also.

#### Steps to be executed by the student (max 6)

*Each bulleted instruction is a complete sentence that describes a specific task.*

- You are in the Market Capitalization Statistics Dashboard and your visuals are not shown correctly. Let's change that. Go to the pencil icon that says Edit and select Dashboard Theme.
- Now, instead of adding colors to the background, let's use an image from the Web. Paste this URL in the corresponding field: https://visme.co/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/50-Beautiful-and-Minimalist-Presentation-Backgrounds-016.jpg.
- Then, change the Tile Background with this hex color code: #213147 and the Tile font color to White.
- Finally, press Save. Your dashboard is ready to have even more visuals, adhering to the brand coloring of your company.

#### Exercise question:
*This is a question presented to learners to check if the steps above were properly completed. It can be a multiple choice question or a question with a 1-3 word answer. It is often not possible to check if all the steps are completed, in this case; the priority is to check that the learner meets the learning objective.*

What is the Share for Software (Internet) Industry of the donut chart?
19.09%
34.39%

#### End goal:

*Add an image of the final visualization here.*
